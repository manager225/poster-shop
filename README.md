Here are some common mistakes people make, check these before filing an issue:

- `EADDRINUSE :::3000`. You already have another application using port 3000. Either end it, or change manually set the `PORT` environment variable to resolve the conflict e.g. `3001`
- Ensure you have a version of Node >= 4

```
node -v
```
